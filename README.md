# React Native Expo Template

This repository serves as a boilerplate for kickstarting React Native projects using the Expo framework. Expo allows you to develop React Native applications without the need for complex setup and configuration, providing a streamlined development experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Additionally, you'll need the Expo CLI, which can be installed globally using the following command:

bashCopy code

`npm install -g expo-cli`

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

bashCopy code

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-native-expo-template.git`

1. Navigate to the project directory:

bashCopy code

`cd react-native-expo-template`

1. Install dependencies:

bashCopy code

`npm install`

### Running the App

Start the Expo development server:

bashCopy code

`npm start`

This will open the Expo DevTools in your default web browser. You can then run the app on an emulator or a physical device by following the instructions in the Expo DevTools.

## Project Structure

The project structure is designed to provide a clear organization of code. Here's an overview:

- assets: Store static assets like images, fonts, etc.
- components: Reusable React components.
- navigation: Navigation setup and configuration.
- screens: React components representing different screens of the app.
- services: Services, utilities, and API-related code.
- theme: Styling and theming configuration.

Feel free to modify and extend the structure based on the needs of your project.

## Features

- Expo Ecosystem: Leverage the power of Expo for a simplified React Native development experience.
- Navigation: Setup with React Navigation for easy navigation between screens.
- Theme Configuration: Customize the app's theme and styling from the centralized theme file.
- Component Reusability: Utilize reusable components to maintain a modular codebase.
- Sample Screens: Includes example screens to help you get started quickly.
